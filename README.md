<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

HelpingHand is a donation platform for everyone to help collect donations for themselves, friends, family or even for people whose fate touches, but you do not know personally, and to support those affected.

### What is the problem?

Those in need require assistance in various life situations. For example, to cover medical or education costs or to finance volunteer service programs. However, intermediaries exist on traditional donation platforms. Here, all the data is stored on a central server. For this reason, there is a security risk and a certain dependence on the provider.

### What is the solution?

The solution here is the decentralized donation platform HelpingHand. Here, too, campaigns (fundraisers) can serve a wide variety of purposes. In addition to medical and educational expenses, clubs or individual athletes can collect donations for their cause.  One can also raise funds for funerals and memorials, and even for animals and pets. The possibilities are endless.

Due to the basic function of the blockchain, all data is stored in encrypted form and is available more securely than with conventional donation platforms. Since all actions are stored in the blockchain, it is possible to see exactly which actions were carried out and when. The individual blocks build on each other, so that manipulation is much more difficult than before.

Another advantage of a blockchain is that there is no central server where all data is stored, but all members of the blockchain store all data. The blockchain network therefore protects itself through its members, thus increasing security.
